        Starting tennis is not as expensive as people think.
        Some of the basic equipment you should get is a starter tennis racket. Tennis rackets 
        come in various different weights, sizes, and colors depending on the skill of a player.
         Any brand tennis balls should be fine for 
        starters and doesn't really have a huge impact on your playing
         Next you should find a public court which many parks have. Additionally you
          should get apropriate
          clothes for the season. I recommend to get good hats for the summer as it 
          can get really hot during summer time depending on where you live. 
          It is also important to find good shoes which are comfortable to play with. If you can 
          also find a partner you can practice with preferably experienced if not
          you can practice with a hitting wall which parks also have.
