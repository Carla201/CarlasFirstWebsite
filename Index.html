                Starting tennis is not as expensive as people think.
                Some of the basic equipment you should get is a starter tennis racket. Tennis rackets 
                come in various different weights, sizes, and colors depending on the skill of a player.
                Any brand tennis balls should be fine for 
                starters and doesn't really have a huge impact on your playing.
                Next you should find a public court which many parks have. Additionally you
                should get apropriate
                clothes for the season. I recommend to get good hats for the summer as it 
                can get really hot during summer time depending on where you live. 
                Comfortable athletic shoes with good grip and support are also necessary to prevent injuries while moving on court. If you can 
                also find a partner you can practice with preferably experienced if not
                you can practice with a hitting wall which parks also have. Optional items like a tennis bag for carrying gear and a good water 
                bottle for hydration can also be helpful.

            Learning The Rules

                    The basic rules of tennis are simple and easy to understand. A match is played between two players for singles or teams of 
                    2 players each for doubles. The objective is to hit the ball over the net into the opponents court aiming to score points when  
                    they fail to return the ball or hit it out of bounds. The scoring system is starts from love meaning 0 to 15,30,40, and game, with a player needing 
                    to win by 2 points if it ever reaches deuce (40-40). Matches are divided into sets, and players must win six games to take a set. Spinning the racket
                    determines who serves first and what side they start on. Serves start the game and players alternate serves every game. If the ball does not land in the service box during a serve
                    its called a fault and they recieve another chance. The player recieves two tries for a serve every point. Rallies, hitting the ball back and fourth, continue 
                    until one player makes an error misses a ball, hits the ball into the net, hit the ball out of bounds.

           Court Basics

                   Learning the parts of the court is essential for starting a game. A tennis court is divided into different sections. The net is what divides the court in half
                   and is what players must hit the ball over during play. The service box is where a serve must land and its divided by the center service line. A player has to 
                   serve the ball into their opposite service box to get the serve in. For example if you are serving on the right you have to aim for the left servicebox. 
                   The center mark on the baseline helps servers position correctly, ensuring they serve to the proper box.
