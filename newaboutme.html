    <p style="font-size: 26px;"> My name is Carla Moreno and I am the creator of this website. I learned coding
        through a program called RWC with coach Anne Marie who showed us the basics of coding and has eventually 
        helped me create this website. It has been so much fun coding and designing this and I am so grateful to have an amazing coach.

    <p style="font-size: 26px;">
        I chose to design a website about tennis because its a sport ive picked up and started to enjoy.
    I started playing tennis around 5 months ago and its a sport that is just incredible. I learned the basics and how
    to play in about 2 months and I wanted to talk about how starting a new sport can be scary 
    but with determination and a positive attitude you can do anything. Through tennis I have made many amazing friends and
    have made many great memories just during my first year in the JV Tennis team. It was super fun learning how to play, practicing and getting better
 with other people and just having fun. I know some people think its boring and not fun but I argue it isn't 
 tennis is a strategic and highly engaging sport that tests both physical and mental abilities. And every match is unique and 
exciting with back and fourth action which requires you to move and think quickly.    </p>
